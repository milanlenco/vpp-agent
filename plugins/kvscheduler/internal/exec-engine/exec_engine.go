// TxnExecEngine is the interface of the transaction execution engine.
// It is a state machine on top of which the transaction operation scheduling is
// operated by KVScheduler.
// A new instance of the engine is created with NewTxnExecEngine(). The constructor
// immediately starts the requested number of worker go routines. The workers
// remain idle, waiting for transaction operations to execute, and get stopped
// when the engine is closed with Close().
// To execute a new transaction, call RunTransaction. The method is synchronous
// (i.e. blocking), but the requested key-value changes are load-balanced across
// workers to maximize the utilization.
//
// The engine is used to help with the graph walk without even understanding the
// details of the graph representation/implementation at this abstraction level.
// Change of every key-value pair (graph node visit) is performed in 4 steps:
//  1. Preparation
//      - the underlying handler is supposed to update the corresponding
//        graph node and the attached edges
//      - opaque context attached to key-value can be used to propagate further
//        input arguments for the execution into the worker (e.g. operation to
//        execute)
//  2. Readiness-check:
//      - determine whether to:
//          - proceed with operation execution
//          - skip operation execution (skip directly to step 4.)
//          - wait for some other key-value pairs (of the same transaction) to
//            be changed first - once those values are finalized, the readiness
//            check is repeated and the value change process continues accordingly
//  3. Execution:
//      - run by one of the workers (i.e. different go routine)
//      - the underlying handler is supposed to execute the given operation
//  4. Finalization:
//      - the underlying handler is supposed to:
//          - update the corresponding graph node to reflect the operation return
//            value
//          - determine if some more key-value pairs need to change as a consequence
//          - opaque context attached to the transaction can be used for example
//            to add recording of the operation, etc.
//          - the instance of the processed KVChange and the attached opaque
//            context are thrown away after the operation
//
// In principle, the steps 1-4 represent a graph node visit. The step 2 may cause
// the visit to be delayed until other nodes have been finalized, step 3 performs
// the actual operation and step 4 may enqueue adjacent nodes to be visited later.
// The next set of nodes to visit is added into the front of the queue, thus
// the graph is walked in the DFS order.
